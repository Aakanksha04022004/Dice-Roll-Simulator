The Python Dice Roll Simulator is a fun and interactive program designed to replicate the experience of rolling dice.
Developed using Python, this project provides users with a virtual dice-rolling environment, allowing them to simulate the randomness and excitement of throwing traditional six-sided dice.
We can also make the dice biased by using the concepts of weights.
